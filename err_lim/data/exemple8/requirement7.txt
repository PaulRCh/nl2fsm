 when the system is in control state1 it produces 2 and the system reaches 3 if the input is b.
 , 2 is produced and the application moves to location 0 if  a occurs when it is in state 6.
 the application returns 1 and location 2 is reached if the input is c when it is in 4.
 from state control state0 , 0 is produced and the system moves to control state1 if  b occurs.
 , 1 is returned and location 6 is reached if the input a occurs from state state 2.
 , 1 is returned and it moves to 5 on occurence of input c in state 1.
 it returns 0 and it moves to control state6 if the input c occurs when it is in control state6.
