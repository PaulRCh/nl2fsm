 when the system is in s0 the output 1 is produced and control states1 is reached if the input is b.
 it returns 0 and the system reaches control states2 on occurence of b when the system is in control states1.
 when it is in control states0 , 0 is produced and it reaches state s3 on occurence of a.
 the output 1 is produced and it reaches s0 if  a occurs from state s1.
 in state state s3 it produces 1 and it reaches location s0 if  b occurs.
 the application returns 1 and control states0 is reached if the input a occurs in  location s2.
 the output 1 is produced and control states3 is reached if the input is a from control states3.
 from state state s2 , 1 is returned and s1 is reached if  b occurs.
