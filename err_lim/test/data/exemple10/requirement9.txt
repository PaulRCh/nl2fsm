 from state s0 it returns 1 and s1 is reached on occurence of input b.
 when it is in state s1 the output 0 is produced and it moves to control states2 if the input b occurs.
 when it is in s0 , 0 is produced and location s3 is reached if the input a occurs.
 when it is in state s1 it produces 1 and control states0 is reached if the input a occurs.
 the system returns 1 and the system reaches control states0 if the input b occurs when the system is in state s3.
 from state s2 the output 1 is produced and the application reaches s0 if  a occurs.
 it produces 1 and s3 is reached if the input is a in  control states3.
 , 1 is produced and s1 is reached if  b occurs from state s2.
