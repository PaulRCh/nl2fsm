 from state location s0 the system returns 1 and it moves to control states4 if  a occurs.
 in  control states4 , 1 is produced and it reaches state s1 on occurence of b.
 when the system is in state s0 , 0 is returned and location s5 is reached if the input is b.
 when the system is in control states4 , 0 is returned and the application moves to control states3 on occurence of a.
 the output 1 is produced and control states2 is reached if the input b occurs from state s1.
 , 1 is produced and the application reaches control states4 on occurence of b in state state s3.
 when the system is in state s3 , 1 is returned and it moves to location s0 if the input a occurs.
 , 0 is produced and the application moves to location s1 on occurence of a in  control states1.
 , 0 is produced and s1 is reached on occurence of input a when the system is in location s2.
 when it is in state s5 the output 0 is produced and the application reaches state s0 if the input b occurs.
 when the system is in s2 the application returns 1 and it moves to s0 if the input b occurs.
 in state control states5 the output 0 is produced and the system reaches s5 on occurence of input a.
