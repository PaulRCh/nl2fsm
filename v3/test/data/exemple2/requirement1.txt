 the output 1 is produced and s1 is reached on occurence of b when it is in location s0.
 the output 1 is produced and the application reaches state s2 if  a occurs from control states0.

 from s2 , 1 is returned and the system reaches location s2 if the input is b.
 , 0 is produced and the system reaches location s0 if the input is b from state location s1.
 it produces 0 and the system moves to control states0 if the input a occurs when it is in state s1.
