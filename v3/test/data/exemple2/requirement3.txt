 , 1 is produced and it moves to state s1 on occurence of input b in  control states0.
 in  control states0 , 1 is produced and the system reaches location s2 on occurence of a.
 , 1 is produced and state s1 is reached if the input is a in state s2.
 it produces 1 and control states2 is reached on occurence of b in  location s2.
 when the system is in state s1 , 0 is produced and the application moves to location s0 on occurence of input b.
 when it is in control states1 the output 0 is produced and it reaches location s0 on occurence of input a.
