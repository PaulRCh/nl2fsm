 the application produces 1 and it moves to control states1 if the input b occurs from state location s0.
 when the system is in location s1 , 0 is produced and the application moves to location s2 on occurence of input b.
 when the system is in s0 , 0 is returned and it reaches location s3 on occurence of a.
 from s1 , 1 is produced and the system reaches state s0 if the input is a.
 it returns 1 and the system moves to s0 if the input is b when it is in control states3.
 in  state s2 the application produces 1 and the system moves to s0 on occurence of input a.
 the output 1 is produced and the system reaches location s3 if the input a occurs when it is in control states3.
 the output 1 is produced and the application moves to control states1 on occurence of input b in  s2.
