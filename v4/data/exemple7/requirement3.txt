 from state 2 the system returns 0 and state 4 is reached if the input c occurs.
 , 0 is produced and the application reaches location 0 if the input b occurs in state location 6.
 the output 1 is produced and location 0 is reached if the input is a when the system is in control state2.
 the output 1 is produced and the system reaches control state1 if the input a occurs in  location 1.
 the application produces 1 and the system moves to control state4 if the input is b in state state 5.
 the output 2 is produced and state 2 is reached if  b occurs in state 2.
 the application returns 0 and it moves to state 3 if  b occurs in  control state1.
 , 1 is returned and it reaches state 4 if  a occurs in  5.
 , 0 is produced and it moves to control state3 if  c occurs from state location 5.
 the system returns 0 and control state1 is reached on occurence of c in  4.
 , 1 is produced and it moves to state 5 if the input is b from state state 4.
 in state state 4 the output 1 is produced and the system moves to location 1 on occurence of a.
 the output 1 is produced and it moves to 2 on occurence of c in state location 1.
 when the system is in control state6 , 1 is returned and the system moves to state 0 if the input a occurs.
