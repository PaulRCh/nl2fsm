 the output 0 is produced and it moves to s2 if  a occurs when the system is in location s0.
 in state state s0 the output 1 is produced and the system reaches s1 if the input b occurs.
 from state s1 the output 0 is produced and state s4 is reached if  a occurs.
 the system produces 0 and it moves to state s3 if the input is b when the system is in control states1.
 , 1 is produced and the application moves to s5 on occurence of a in  control states3.
 when the system is in state s3 , 1 is produced and the system moves to control states3 on occurence of input b.
 in state location s5 the output 1 is produced and it reaches control states0 if the input is a.
 , 0 is produced and the application moves to control states1 on occurence of input b from state s4.
 from state s5 the output 0 is produced and it reaches state s1 if  b occurs.
 when the system is in state s2 , 0 is returned and the system reaches s0 if the input b occurs.
 the output 0 is produced and the application moves to control states3 on occurence of input a in state location s2.
 , 0 is returned and control states2 is reached if the input a occurs when it is in state s4.
