 it returns 1 and s1 is reached if the input is b when the system is in control states0.
 in state state s1 , 0 is returned and the system reaches control states2 if the input is b.
 when the system is in s0 the system produces 0 and the system reaches control states3 on occurence of a.
 when it is in state s1 , 1 is produced and state s0 is reached if the input is a.
 the system returns 1 and it moves to control states0 if  b occurs in state location s3.
 , 1 is produced and location s0 is reached if the input a occurs when the system is in state s2.
 the application produces 1 and state s3 is reached if the input a occurs when it is in location s3.
 the output 1 is produced and the system moves to control states1 if the input b occurs from state s2.
